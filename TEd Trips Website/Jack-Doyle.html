				<h2 class="card-title text-shadow text-black text-uppercase mb-0">Fr Jack Hackett</h2>
            <h4 class="text-shadow text-black">Drink More Drink</h4>

				<p class="text-justify">Father Jack is a surly, rude, alcoholic, senile, foul-mouthed and occasionally violent priest, who frequently lapses into aggressive behavior, especially when his fellow clergy deny him alcohol (which he refers to as "drink"). Jack makes no attempt to mask his contempt for his fellow clergy and pretty much anyone else he encounters. He rarely speaks in a coherent manner (possibly a result of his constant drunkenness) and often shouts out a series of random words: "Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!" sometimes accompanied by convenient hearing making him shout "What!" He occasionally has outbursts including "Knickers" and "Women's knickers".
				<p>He was sent to the Craggy Island parochial house after a disastrous wedding in Athlone of which he has fond memories. Jack spends most of the day sitting in an old armchair in the parish house sitting room. He is often found drinking, sleeping, shouting out profane obscenities or acting rudely to other people in the room. 
					Despite his cranky nature, Fr. Jack is the liveliest character when out on a night around town. Bring him to any pub and he’s the best company you could wish for! Better than that, he knows every watering hole worth your time in Dublin.</p> <p>Sign up for a pub crawl with Fr. Jack!</p>

				<h2 class="card-title text-shadow text-black text-uppercase mb-0">Mrs Doyle </h2>
            <h4 class="text-shadow text-black">Ah Go on </h4>

				<p class="text-justify"> Ms. Doyle appears to dress similar to many a middle-aged housekeeper who resides in the Irish countryside. Although she has glasses, she hates wearing them as they highlight her shabby look. She also has problems seeing when wearing them, evident when she puts them on and tells Ted that she can't find her way to the kitchen.
				<p>Mrs Doyle is characterized as being hyperactive, repressed and very persistent. At times capable of being very angry, such as when someone refuses the offer of a cup of tea, to which she will then respond with "Go on" which she usually repeats, getting quicker each time. This occasionally causes injury to those around her. 
With her love of tea, you can’t go wrong with Mrs. Doyle- enjoy high tea in her company, where she’ll make sure to keep your cups flowing and the tales coming.</p><p> Ah go on ---- pick me pick me </p>
