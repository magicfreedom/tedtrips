            <h4 class="text-shadow text-black">Drink More Drink</h4>

				<p class="text-justify">Dublin is a city of pubs... over 1000 of them! Fr jack did try count them all for us even he couldn’t keep up. The highest pub in Dublin is where this trip begins. Johnny Fox’s pub in the Dublin hills. From there its back to the Stags Head in the city. A pub established in 1780 and a prime example of Victorian design. They also serve a great meal. Then were off to the Brazen Head established back in 1198 and blessed by Fr Jack himself on its first day. This was a fond drinking hole of Robert Emmet, Wolfe Tone and Daniel O’Connell though Fr Jack swears it was Daniel O’Donnell!  </p>
