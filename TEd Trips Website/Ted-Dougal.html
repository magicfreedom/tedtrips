				<h2 class="card-title text-shadow text-black text-uppercase mb-0">Fr Ted Crilly</h2>
            <h4 class="text-shadow text-black">It was only resting in my account</h4>

				<p class="text-justify">Fr. Ted studied theology at the seminary, St. Colm's. He seemed to be bullied by the other priests there, being teased for wetting the bed and being given the nickname Father Fluffybottom due to some downy fluff growing around his posterior. He eventually graduated and entered into the priesthood. 
				<p>Ted was banished to Craggy Island as punishment from Bishop Brennan for stealing a child's Lourdes money so he could go to Las Vegas. He escaped charges but was still punished by Brennan. Ted always maintains the money was just resting in his account, but he was to remain on the island til all the money had been accounted for</p>.
				<p>Ted has a competitive spirit, always competing with Fr. Dick Byrne when the occasion allows it, and is no stranger to a bit of gambling. He’s always up for a night out to the dogs and is always up for boosting a team’s spirit (in fact, there isn’t much he loves more)</p></p>Book here for a fun time out with Fr. Ted! </p>

				<h2 class="card-title text-shadow text-black text-uppercase mb-0">Fr Dougal Mc Quire</h2>
            <h4 class="text-shadow text-black">I am too busy looking holy </h4>

				<p class="text-justify">Fr. Dougal is generally considered a bit on the slow side, a dim-witted and ignorant young priest (he once merrily confessed that "the lights are on but there's no one home"), Dougal has no belief in or even a remote understanding of Catholicism, once admitting that he believes more in Darth Vader and Phantom of the Opera than he does in God. 
				<p>Ted reminds him to write down people that don't exist on a list, such as Magnum, P.I. and the Loch Ness Monster.</p>
				<p>He reveals to Ted that he does not believe in the afterlife and that he wishes he shared Ted's own faith in the concept. Dougal believes Catholicism to be a "bit of a laugh" which is not to be taken seriously and expresses much confusion and doubt as to the origins of mankind as described in the Bible. He hints that he believes in extraterrestrial life and claims to have once seen a ghost, which was revealed to actually be TedEnjoy an alternative history tour of Dublin with Fr. Dougal, who’s always got new facts hidden up his sleeve.</p>
				 <p>Share Dougal's perspective of the city</P> <p>It's very interesting to say the least. </P>
